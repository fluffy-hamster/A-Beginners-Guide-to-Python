    "## Features of Good Design\n",
    " \n",
    "Hi guys, this lecture is a bit different, today we are mostly glossing over Python itself and instead we are going to be talk about software development. \n",
    " \n",
    "At this moment in time you are writing tiny programs. This is all good experience but you will quickly learn that as programs that larger the harder it is to get working. For example, writing two-hundred one page letters to your grandma over the course of a year is much easier than trying to write a two-hundred page novel. The main reason being is that the bunch of letters are mostly independent bits of writing, whereas a novel requires hundreds of pages to 'flow' together.\n",
    " \n",
    "I’d argue software development is a bit like that too; writing small programs is very different from writing code for large complex systems. For small problems if things go wrong you can just start 'from scratch' whereas for large systems starting from scratch is often not possible (and/or would take years), and so any mistakes made in the design of the system are likely 'warts' you are going to have to live with. As codebases grow concepts like readability become increasingly important. \n",
    "\n",
    "Today’s lecture is intended as an introduction to some of skills you will likely need once you try to develop a substantial programs. **The TLDR version; figuring out a good design ‘off the bat’ can potentially save you hours upon hours of work later on down the line.**\n",
    " \n",
    "Today I will be showing you an example of how we might code up a game of chess. But crucially I’m going to skip over a lot of the ‘low-level’ stuff and instead try to provide a ‘high-level’ sketch for what such a program may look like. If you have the time it may be worthwhile to quickly skim back over the *intuition for OOP* lecture. \n",
    " \n",
    "There is a saying in England:\n",
    " \n",
    ">“[you] can’t see the forest for the trees”*. \n",
    " \n",
    "It means that if you examine something closely (i.e. each tree) you might miss the bigger picture (i.e. that all the trees come together to make a forest). Most of this lecture series has been talking about trees, but today we are talking about the forest. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is good design?\n",
    "\n",
    "So before we start looking at a chess game lets say a few words about design; in particular, what counts as good program design?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simplicity\n",
    "\n",
    "    Simple is better than complex.\n",
    "    Complex is better than complicated.\n",
    "    [...]\n",
    "    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.\n",
    "    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.\n",
    "    \n",
    "As always, Tim Peter's ‘Zen of Python’ has a thing or two to say about design, the lines highlighted here place an emphasis on simplicity and clarity of expression, these concepts are core to the entire language and we would do well to remember that;  if things start to get complicated maybe it would be prudent to take a step back and reconsider our approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Performance\n",
    " \n",
    "At first glance we might think performance is a 'low-level' consideration. You write something and then find ways to save a byte of memory here or there. But considering performance merely as ‘fine-tuning’ would be a crucial mistake. \n",
    " \n",
    "Those of you that read my 'joy of fast cars' lecture would have seen a few examples of such low-level 'fine tuning', in one example I showed how we could optimize a call to range such that we could search for prime numbers faster. And for what its worth this tinkering did in fact pay off, significantly so, in fact.\n",
    " \n",
    "However, that lecture also contained a ‘high-level’ idea as well; our tinkering with the range function was, although faster, still blindly searching for *a needle in a haystack*. We then stepped back and wondered if there was a better way to do it and indeed there was; *generating* primes is better than blindly *searching* for them.\n",
    " \n",
    "The lesson here is that good design choices, even if executed poorly, can easily out-perform bad ideas implemented well. If you want to know more about this, please check do some reading on [‘algorithmic complexity’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms) and Big(O) notation (we wont cover this stuff in this course).\n",
    " \n",
    "In short, good design/algorithm choices tend to be very performant once we scale up the problem to huge data sets, and this is why it’s worth taking the time to come up with a good idea. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Readable\n",
    " \n",
    "Throughout this lectures series I have highlighted readability numerous times so I'm going to keep this section super short:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Readability Counts!\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Modular\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity is one way to deal with complexity. In short, this is where we try to chop everything up into neat little boxes, where each little box has just one job to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative (and terrible) design would be to have one big box that does everything. The problem with such an approach is that you end up with a complex spider web, and you fear changing one small part because you don't know how that small change may affect the entire system. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generalisable / Reusable\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing good code once and then reusing it is often better than starting from scratch each time. The way to make code reusable is to generalise it to solve variety of problems. This concept is probably best understood by example. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we were making a function that counted *1-to-100*. What can we use this for other than its intended purpose? \n",
    "\n",
    "Now suppose we write a function that counts from *n-to-m*. This code works for the current problem but because its design is generalised we may be able to reuse this code at a later date, in this project or the next. \n",
    "\n",
    "If code is reusable, then that is often a good sign that it is modular as well. "

    "#### Beauty\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Beautiful is better than ugly.*  \n",
    "Tim Peters, ‘Zen of Python’\n",
    "\n",
    "Beauty!? At first glance making beauty a consideration my sound like a strange or 'out-of-place' concept. But if you take a broad view of human achievement you’ll find that we mere mortals make things, and then make those things beautiful.  Just think of something like a sword, it is an object made with the most brutal of applications in mind and yet we still decided that even this was an object worthy of being made beautiful. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another discipline where discussions of aesthetics may initially seem out-of-place is mathematics, and yet, there are no shortage of mathematicians throughout the ages  discussing the [aesthetic qualities of field](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-h-bailey/why-mathematics-matters_b_4794617.html) and moreover there is some [experimental evidence](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-26151062) to suggest mathematicians genuinely see beauty in formula's in the same way the rest of us see beauty in music or art. For some, beauty truly is the joy of mathematics.\n",

    "\n",
    "I think it would be wrong to dismiss beauty as a trivial aspect of mathematics or programming for that matter.  There truly is a joy in experiencing good code, you just need to learn to appreciate it, I guess. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Building a Chess Program...\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay so the above discussion highlighted a few aspirations and considerations for our chess project. Let’s start by making a list of all the things we need to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Represent the board (8x8 grid, alternating black/white squares)\n",
    "1. Define piece movement, capture rules.\n",
    "1. Define all other rules (e.g. promotion, castling, checkmate, 3-fold repetition, etc)\n",
    "1. Peripherals (e.g. clocks, GUI's, multiplayer features like match-making, etc)\n",
    "\n",
    "Thats a lot of stuff to do right there, today's lecture will mostly deal with points one and two.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building the board\n",
    "\n",
    "How should we represent a board in Python? This question mostly just boils down to what data-type we should use. Right now, I have two candidates in mind; strings and lists. \n",
    "\n",
    "We could of course jump ‘straight-in’, pick one the data types at random and see what happens but, as alluded to in the above discussions such a method is both silly and wasteful. A better use of time would be to carefully consider our options BEFORE we write even a single line of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Board as a string\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, so let’s consider using a string for the board. What might that look like?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, the letters \"QKPN\" could represent the pieces (lower-case for white), and we could use the new-line character (\"\\\\n\") to separate the rows. Something like this:"

    "Okay so the board as a string seems possible, but are there any drawbacks of an implementation like this? Well, I can think of two. Firstly, notice that because these unicode characters are a bigger than normal letters we are going to need a new way to denote black and white squares. You can see from above I tried to use a combination of spaces and ‘□■’ characters but even then the formating is a bit off.
