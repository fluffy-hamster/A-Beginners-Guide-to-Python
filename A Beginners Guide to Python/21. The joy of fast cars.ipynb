    "# The joy of fast cars \n",
    "\n",
    "Hi guys, so in this lecture I wanted to talk about speed in Python. Now, as beginners I want to emphasize that you guys should be focusing on writing *correct* programs and not pay too much mind to how fast they run. But with that said I do think that thinking about the speed of code can actually be fun; its problem solving and a challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'joy of fast cars' is a somewhat cryptic title, but the explanation of it is fairly straight-forward; one of the things I find a lot of fun is trying to make my code more efficient; I genuinely enjoy the process of taking a bit of code and trying to come up with ways to make it faster.  In my mind programming is at its most interesting when you can can look past stuff like language syntax and instead focus of the very nature of the problem itself. The aim of today is to try to get you a glimpse of that. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem we shall be looking at today is the following:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    How can we list all of the prime numbers from 0 to N?\n",
    "    \n",
    "Lets start the process by spliting the process into two parts; first, we need a way of knowing if a number is prime or not. And once we have that, we need to check all the numbers 0 to N. "

This makes a lot of sense when you think about it; the minimum number of ‘integer parts’ we can split X into (besides 1) is two. Thus, when we start looking at numbers greater than n/2 the solution will never be a whole number. And that stands for all numbers, not just 20. \n",
