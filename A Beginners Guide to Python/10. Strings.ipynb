    "# Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous lectures we have seen strings being used numerous times. Today we are going to go into a bit more detail. First, some terminology:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 'single-quote character' refers to unicode character 34,  --> { ' }\n",
    "* 'double-quote character' refers to unicode character 39,  --> { \" }\n",
    "* and if I say 'quote-character' then I refer to both/either of the above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, lets begin!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a string?\n",
    "\n",
    "A string is basically a bunch of unicode characters, this makes them the ideal data type for storing written text. The Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "    {quote-character} unicode characters {MATCHING quote-character}\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"hello\" # Valid syntax\n",
    "* 'hello' # also valid syntax\n",
    "* \"hello' # doesn't work; uses both quotation characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "And just as with numbers, we can also convert other data-types to strings using the str function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why do both single and double quote characters work?\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason Python accepts the use of single OR double quote characters is to make it easier for dealing with text that actually contains quote-characters. Suppose for instance we wanted to store the following sentence as a string:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Ahhh!!!! spiders!\", cried the monster. \"Do not worry\" said our hero, \"I have a sharp spoon\".\n",
    "\n",
    "wow, I'm hooked; with epic character development like that maybe I should be writing novels instead of programming tutorials?\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, I digress. The point is if I try to save this sentence with double-quotes, problems occur. But I can save the string as is if wrap my string with single-quote characters. As demonstrated by the next two code snippets."
