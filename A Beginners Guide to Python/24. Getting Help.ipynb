    "Before we begin though, I'd like to point out that you should, in my opinion, really spend a good chunk of time trying to fix the issue yourself before you go to somebody else pleading for the answer. There are a few reasons for this, the first is that not many people like to help people with information easily obtained via a quick google search. And secondly, struggling with a problem and finally cracking it is a often frustrating but nonetheless a good way to learn. \n",
