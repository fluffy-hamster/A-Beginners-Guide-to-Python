    "\n",
    "And before you consider all this a bit far-fetched, it is worth considering that medical accidents involving software bugs have happened before. The Therac-25 was a radiation therapy machine that on least six separate occasions delivered a radiation dose 100x more powerful than they should have been; all due to a software bug. \n",
    "\n",
    "A commission looking into these incidents cited several safety breaches and poor practices that lead to this disaster. For our purposes, this paragraph stands out:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"The system noticed that something was wrong and halted the X-ray beam, but merely displayed the word \"MALFUNCTION\" followed by a number from 1 to 64. The user manual did not explain or even address the error codes, so the operator pressed the P key to override the warning and proceed anyway.\"  ~ [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25#Root_causes)\n",
    "\n",
    "What can we learn from this? \n",
    "\n",
    "1. It might not be a good idea to simply report \"MALFUNCTION 15\" when you are killing people (readability counts).\n",
    "2. If you must have a error message as abstruse as \"MALFUNCTION 15\" it might be a good idea to jot down \"This means you are killing people\" somewhere (documentation matters).  \n",
    "3. Maybe make it harder to kill people than merely typing \"P\" on the keyboard? (serious errors should be given weight)\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically the Therac-25 machine did raise errors but the mistake made was to not have a those errors mean anything to the end-user. Because the danger was not made explicit people literally died; When things go wrong it is crucial that error messages are not only raised but also respected. Personally I think the moral of the story here is that when things go wrong it is crucial that error messages are not only raised but also respected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, most of the time you won't be writing medical software where life and death is litterally at stake. Nonetheless I think the general point stands; **errors are often better than bad data.** And for that reason, writing code that raises a lot of errors when used incorrectly is actually fine. But when errors are raised they should be (a) easy to interpret and (b) as close to the source of the problem as possible.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusions...\n",
    "\n",
    "So what are the lessons to be learned from today's lecture? Well we learnt about what operator overloading is and how, if we are not careful this can lead to software bugs. We also learnt that the 'Python way' is to give the end-user a lot of freedom to use our code how they please but that freedom is implicitly built on trust. This is one of the reasons why good documentation matters. \n",
    " \n",
    "And finally, we also learnt that having error messages pop up every once in awhile is often preferable to returning a bad output. As beginners error messages may feel like a major pain in ass but ultimately they are there to help you write correct code. I hope that my medical example above gives you a different perspective on error messages. "
