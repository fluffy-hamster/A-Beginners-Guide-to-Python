    "In the above we ran one line of code and out popped a poem, and as we go through the course more and more lines of this poem should start to make sense to you. But before all that, let's talk about 'import'.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Import\n",
    "\n",
    "The Import statement is basically us saying to the computer:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *\"Hey Python, can you go fetch to other bit of code that someone else wrote? thanx mate.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this particular case, we are importing something called \"this\". Python has a few easter-eggs and inside jokes dotted around the place, you can read about the history of how ‘import this’ became a thing by clicking [here](https://www.wefearchange.org/2010/06/import-this-and-zen-of-python.html).\n",
    "\n",

    "    The Syntax:\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Readability counts.\n",
    "1. Explicit is better than Implicit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part One will speak about readability, part two will talk about the distinction between implicit/explicit code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Readability counts\n",
    "\n",
    "On numerous occasions through-out this course I will refer to the idea the readability matters, indeed, we have already seen the importance of good names, but readability has a much larger scope than that. Most of the my lectures will focus on *how *code can made more readable, but in this lecture I want to try to explain *why* readability counts. \n",
    "\n",
    "The TLDR version:\n",
    "* Readability is at the heart of Python's ethos.\n",
    "* Everything else we care about 'flows' from readable code. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second bullet point is a bit cryptic, but once I’ve finished explaining it will make sense, I promise. \n",
    "Aright, so let’s imagine we are trying to build the ‘perfect’ bit of software. What properties would it have?\n",
    "\n",
    "* It would be performant\n",
    "* correct\n",
    "* bug free\n",
    "* easy to use\n",
    "* easy to maintain, improve, change\n",
    "* full of useful features\n",
    "* well documented\n",
    "\n",
    "So that’s a nice list of qualities that exemplary software would have. The interesting thing to note here is that readability helps with every single one of these bullet points. \n",
    "\n",
    "Take the first point, performance, how does readabilty help here? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, imagine being handed a novel with all the pages out of order, think about how much harder and how much more time consuming understanding that novel would be relative to being given a copy with the correct page numbers; working with messy code is very much like the disordered novel. If the code is messy the development team has to spend a lot of time just understanding how the pieces fit together, they have to do that before they can actually go about making meaningful performance improvements. The readable code meanwhile is understood in a much shorter space of time, our team of hypothetical developers can therefore spend more of their time and energy focused on the actual task at hand. \n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the less your developers have to wonder about how something works, the more time they have to innervate, tinker, and toy with the code. The result (over long peroids of time) is faster code with fewer bugs and more features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The lesson here is that readability isn’t a ‘nice-to-have extra’, rather, its a core ingredient for great code. When writing code I want you guys to always ask yourself the following two questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Does my code work like it is supposed to?  (correctness is *the* single most important thing, afterall).\n",
    "1. Can I make my code more readable?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you keep on asking yourself these two basic questions when writing code then you'll be writing *good code* in no time at all!\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**POP QUIZ!** Can you guys figure out what the follow code snippet does?"

However, the major drawback to this code is it doesn't use any *defensive programming* techniques and as a consequence the code may break when we give it unexpected input (the *‘operator overloading’* lecture will go into the specifics). Now, writing code without test cases or checks is acceptable in many cases, but having no tests/checks AND no documentation is just asking for trouble! \n",
    "\n",
    "Basically the problem with the above code is that it makes no effort to protect and/or warn the user about what happens when you feed it “dodgy” input;  there are no 'hard checks' within the code itself to *ensure* the user is calling it correctly and nor is there any documentation that *tells* the end user how to use it properly. \n",

    "> \"Prevention is better than cure\". \n",
    "\n",
    "How can we prevent problems? Well, there are hundreds upon hundreds of ways to do that, but this code doesn’t even try.\n",
