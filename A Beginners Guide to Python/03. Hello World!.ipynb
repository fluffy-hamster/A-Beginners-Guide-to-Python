    "In this lecture, we shall be focusing on Python's print statement. As the word ‘print’ may suggest, this a command in Python that, err, prints to the console whatever you fed it as input. The syntax is:\n",
    "     \n",
    "     print({argument})\n",
    "\n",
    "Please take care to note that \"print\" is all lower-case (**Python is case-sensitive**). And don't forget the curly brackets! \"()\" \n",
    "\n",
    "As a quick side-node, if you see python code on the internet you may occassionaly see print statements without brackets:\n",
    "\n",
    "    print \"hello\"\n",
    "    print (\"hello\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "The most likely explanation of this difference is that the print statement used to work differently in Python 2. In Python 3, you need the brackets. \n",

    "### How I present Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Before moving on, I’d like to make quick note about how I talk about syntax in Python. In the lectures where I chose to talk about syntax I use the format above. With the exception of the “{}” symbols, you should assume that **all the the symbols/words are deliberate.** In other words if you see a symbol such as comma (“,”), a colon (“:”) or whatever its there because Python needs it to be there! \n",
    "\n",
    "The exception to this rule is text sandwiched between the “{}” brackets. This is usually 'place-holder' text that you would need to change.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this particular case you should remove {argument} and replace with whatever you want to print. Lets run through a few examples:"
