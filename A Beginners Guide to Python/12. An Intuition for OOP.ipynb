    "Similarly, there are lot of operations that might make sense with other objects but not a ball. For example, it makes sense to 'plug in' a kettle or toaster, but it’s not clear what 'plugging in' a ball actually means.Likewise, we can make sense of \"subtract 7 from 9\", but it is not clear what is meant when somebody says \"subtract 7 from a ball\".\n",

    "If you want to know why an object in Python has method ‘Y’ and another object (of a different type) does not have a method ‘Y’ the ball example above hopefully helps you make sense of it. In the case of strings, we can add them together because we have a clear idea how that should work. But we can’t subtract strings because it isn’t clear what should happen in a number of cases. For example, “AB” subtract “B” we can make some sense of, the result should probably just be “A”. But what about following cases:\n",

    "In each case it is NOT intuitively clear what should happen. The Python developers could have implemented subtraction for strings and handled all these cases in one way or another.

We also want the ball bounce off of the ground and other objects too.\n",

    "As a minor implementation detail my code adds Time to other Time objects, if we try to add an integer (e.g 4) to the time 10:30 we get an error. The reason for this is if we get handed an integer it is not entirely clear what should to happen; should we assume the integer is hours? But couldn’t that integer just as easily be minutes or total elapsed time (e.g 65 means 1:05) ? Since it's not clear, we don't guess. Instead we just yield an error.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to remember that more or less everything in Python is an object. Strings are an object, Integers are an object and so on. Objects have methods (which are usually, although not always, functions) that can be called on them. Moreover, as we have seen above we can use the \"class\" keyword in Python to build our own objects with a corresponding set of methods. \n",
