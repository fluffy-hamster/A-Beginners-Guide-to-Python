    "Okay, so what does try & except actually do?  Well basically, Python tries to execute a statement, but if in the process of executing that statement an error (of type ErrorMessage) occurs then we to something else instead. In terms of logic, try/except works a bit like if/elif work. Here is a simple example:"

    "So what’s going on here? Well, we have list which contains several different data-types. For every 'item' we try to multiply item by itself. If 'item' is a number this makes sense and so we print item * item. However, if we try to multiply a string by a string we get a TypeError, which the except statement catches. So if we receive a TypeError we try something else, in this particular case we add item to item, and thus \"aa\", \"bb\", etc get printed.\n",

    "So why is it bad to leave a bare except statement? Well, as I've stated elsewhere in these lecture series it is often better to crash than it is to output junk. And please trust me when I say bare except clauses are a great way to output junk.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the second case we specifically state the errors we except to sometimes receive. And this is nice for a few reasons, first, by naming the exceptions the code is a bit more readable. Secondly, expressly stating the errors forces you to be much more *mindful* when writing the code in the first place. And thirdly, if something unexpected does happen then, unless you have bare except statements throughout all of your code eventually you'll pass junk data to some function and get an error there. So basically in many cases you are not really *solving* the problem, you end up *delaying* the problem. \n",
