    "\n",
    "Please note that this is a bit of a oversimplification, I should have said a ‘unique’ name within the ‘scope’ of the variable. but for that sentence to make sense you would need to understand the concept of *\"scope\"* in Python. So for now, let's ignore the intricacies and keep it simple: a variable is a *unique name* that has some *value* attached to it. \n",
