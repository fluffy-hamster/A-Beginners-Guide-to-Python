    "In this lecture we are going to be looking at *methods*. To simplify, a method is a function that is bound to a particular type of object. String methods, for example, are functions that only work on strings. List methods meanwhile, are a set of functions that only work on lists. And so and so on. If you read the OOP lecture this should make sense to you already. \n",
