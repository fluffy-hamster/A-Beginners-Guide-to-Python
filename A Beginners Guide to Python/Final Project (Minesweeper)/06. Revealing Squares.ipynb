    "Okay so lets quickly recap where we are at with this project:\n",
    " \n",
    "* We have built the 'board function'\n",
    "* We can print the board.\n",
    "* We can set the board to display the correct number of neughor bombs.\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally, let's quickly consider what we have left to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "* create a 'reveal square' function.\n",
    "* create a 'flag square' function.\n",
    "* Add win/loss checks, a UI, set-up functions, bling\n",
    "* Bring everything together\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we shall be focus on the reveal square function.\n",

    "## ToDo\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, so here's the basic implementation idea. When we start a new game we create two boards:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The 'game board' (with bombs) -- Hidden from player\n",
    "* The 'player board' (with flags and numbers) -- This is what the players sees during the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "The player board will have the same dimensions as the game board. This means that the square (0, 0) on the game board corressponds to same square on the player board. You may remember that when we wrote the 'build_board' function I advised you to make it generalisable. Well, the effort is about to pay-off; we can create both of our boards with just a few lines of code:"
