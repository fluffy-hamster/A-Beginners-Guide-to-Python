    "At the fundamental level computers work by flicking on and off trillions of little switches (transistors). \n",
    "\n",
    "When Python receives a number (in any base) it converts that number into base 2 (binary). This is because at the fundamental level computers run on binary (1’s and 0’s get further converted into electrical current; say 2V for 1 and 0V for 0). \n",
    "\n",
    "So numbers start at base 10 → are converted to base 2 → and then are converted back again. Sometimes information can be lost in this process. As a result sometimes Python will give you weird answers to basic arithmetic questions. It might seem like a bug when it happens. But actually, these ‘quirks’ are just a consequence of how floats are implemented at the low level.\n",
