    "In the above we ran one line of code and out popped a poem, and as we go through the course more and more lines of this poem should start to make sense to you. But before all that, let's talk about 'import'.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Import\n",
    "\n",
    "The Import statement is basically us saying to the computer:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Hey Python, can you go fetch to other bit of code that someone else wrote? thanx mate.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In this particular case, we are importing something called \"this\". Python has a few easter-eggs and inside jokes dotted around the place, you can read about the history of how ‘import this’ became a thing by clicking [here](https://www.wefearchange.org/2010/06/import-this-and-zen-of-python.html).\n",

    "\timport {Name of module we wish to import}\n",

    "Anyway, I digress; the actual focus of today's lecture is to study the meaning of two lines found within Tim Peter's poem. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Readability counts.\n",
    "1. Explicit is better than Implicit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part One will speak about readability, part two will talk about the distinction between implicit/explicit code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Readability counts\n",
    "\n",
    "On numerous occasions throughout this course I will refer to the idea that readability matters, indeed, we have already seen the importance of good names, but readability has a much larger scope than that. Most of my lectures will focus on *how *code can made more readable, but in this lecture I want to try to explain *why* readability counts. \n",
    "\n",
    "The TLDR version:\n",
    "* Readability is at the heart of Python's ethos.\n",
    "* Everything else we care about 'flows' from readable code. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second bullet point is a bit cryptic, but once I’ve finished explaining it will make sense, I promise. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, let’s imagine we are trying to build the ‘perfect’ bit of software. What properties would it have? Its an abstract question, but here are a free of my ideas of what 'perfect code' would look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "* it would be performant\n",
    "* correct\n",
    "* bug free\n",
    "* safe (e.g no security defects that could be attacked)\n",
    "* easy to use (for the end-user)\n",
    "* easy to maintain, improve, change (for programmers)\n",
    "* integrates nicely with other code/infrastructure. \n",
    "\n",
    "So that’s a nice list of qualities that exemplary software would have. The interesting thing to note here is that readability helps with every single one of these bullet points. \n",
    "\n",
    "Take the first point, performance, how does readability help here? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, imagine being handed a novel with all the pages out of order. Think about how much harder and how much more time consuming understanding that novel would be relative to being given a copy with the correct page numbers; working with messy code is very much like the disordered novel. If the code is messy the development team has to spend a lot of time just understanding how the pieces fit together, they have to do that before they can actually go about making meaningful performance improvements. The readable code meanwhile is understood in a much shorter space of time, therefore our team of hypothetical developers can thus spend more of their time and energy focused on the actual task at hand. \n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the less developers have to wonder about *how* something works, the more time they have to innervate, tinker, and toy with the code. The result (over long periods of time) is faster code with fewer bugs and more features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The lesson here is that readability isn’t a ‘nice-to-have extra’, rather, it's a core ingredient for great code. And so, when writing code I want you guys to always ask yourself the following two questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Does my code work like it is supposed to?  (correctness is *the* single most important thing, after all).\n",
    "1. Can I make my code more readable?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you keep on asking yourself these two basic questions when writing code then you'll be writing *good code* in no time at all!\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, bugs and security flaws often lurk in the shadows. So, one way to avoid these problems is to avoid the number of shadows there are in the first place. In this analogys, the shadows refer to confusing bits of code that are difficult to understand. Complexity obscures things, simplicity reveals the truth. \n",
