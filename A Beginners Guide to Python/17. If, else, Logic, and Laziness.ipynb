    "1. Your job is to evaluate the expression (P operator Q) **in the fastest time possible.**\n",

    "\n",
    "Why? Well, in order to prove that (P and Q) is False we only have to prove that either P or Q is False. In this case, its pretty easy to see that Q is false, therefore we know the answer of (P and Q) without having to prove the twin primes conjecture.\n",

    "    “The statement (P or Q) is True, and the fastest strategy is to calculate statement P first.\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "Similar to the problem above, to prove (P or Q) is True we only have to prove either P or Q is True. In this case, we can quickly check 7 is prime and thus we can solve the problem without even attempting to solve the np=p problem *(which btw, has a million dollar prize for the first person to prove it)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, so how can we use this information in our Python programmes? Well Python uses the same \"lazy\" evaluation as we did above; if we know A is True we don't have to calculate B in order to know (A or B) is True. \n",

    "So how can we take advantage of this? Well, the syntax is simple, Python evaluates left-to-right. So in the case of P or Q Python ALWAYS checks P first. **To take advantage then, what we should do is give Python the easiest statement first and then the slower one.** \n",

    "In short, understanding Python’s lazy evaluation can speed up you code considerably (without any cost to readability). As a general rule, to make use of lazy evaluation all you need to do is put the thing that is fastest to evaluate first and the slowest thing last. For maximum efficiency you would need to figure out what it minimum about of work you need to do in order to arrive at an answer."
