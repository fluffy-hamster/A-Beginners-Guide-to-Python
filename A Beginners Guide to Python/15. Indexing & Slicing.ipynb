    "\n",
    "Okay guys today's lecture is indexing. \n",

    "> What is indexing?\n",
    "\n",
    "At heart, indexing is the ability to inspect a value inside a object. So basically if we have a list, X, of 100 items and  our index is 'i' then 'i of X' returns the *ith value* inside the list (p.s. we can index strings too).\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, so what is the Syntax for this? Glad you asked:\n",
    "\n",
    "    {variable} [{integer}]\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we wanted to index into something called \"a_string\" in code it would look something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a_string[integer]\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the integer in question cannot be any number from -infinity to +infinity. Rather, it is bounded by the size of the variable. For example, if the size of the variable is 5 that means our integer has to be in the range -5 to 4. Or more generally:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Index Range :: \n",
    "    Lower Bound = -len(variable)\n",
    "    Upper Bound =  len(variable) - 1 \n",
    "    Anything outside this range = IndexError\n",
    "    \n",
    "Just as a quick explanation, len() is a built-in command that gets the size of the object and adding a \"-\" sign infront of an integer 'flips' its sign:"
